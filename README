This support module was created to control and monitor the Tektronix
TDS3000 series scopes.  It uses asyn-streamdevice to communicate with the
instrument.  It was developed with epics-R3-14-9 and depends on the following
modules:
 asyn-R4-9,
 stream-R2-3,
 genSub-R1-6,
 seq-R2-0-11.

The edm screens are in
$(IOC_TOP)/tds3000/tds3000-R1-0/display.
The sources are in
$(MODULE_TOP)/tds3000/tds3000-R1-0/tds3000App.
It needs edm-1-11-1d or later for the x-y graph to work properly.

How does it work?
- the sequencer consists of four tasks:
  1. savRest, is the save/restore instrument configuration task.
     It is activated when a button is pressed on the MORE/UTIL screen.
     It gets the configuration screen and writes it to a disk file or
     restores previously saved configuration string from a disk file.
     The default value, which is set in the sequencer code can be overwritten
     via a parameter to the sequencer program in the st.cmd file.  An example
     of that is
       seq sncTds3x,"P=TDS3:,FN=/usr/local/data/myconfig.txt"
     The file path can also be changed interractively, see the UTIL screen.
  2. acquire, controls which channel waveform should be transfered next.
     This is implemented as a round robin of all enabled channels.  Hence,
     one waveform is transfered per refresh period.
  3. chkChan, whatches for transitions in the channel enable buttons on the
     instrument and if a change is detected, then the write enable PV is
     put in the same state as the button.  This way the edm button for this
     channel is forced to reflect the correct state of the channel.
  4. doRate, is used to clear both counters used in rate calculation.
     The calculated rate shows how many traces are obtained per second.
     It can be view in the MORE/DEBG screen.

- genSub is used to:
  1. convert the waveform data using offset and scale from values read from
     the instrument.  The same routine is also used to zero the trace data
     when the channel is disabled.  The sequencer acquire sequence is also
     involved in this.
  2. handle an interractive command, see screen MORE/CMND.

- the rest is implemented using epics records.
